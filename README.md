SUPER STORE SALES POWER BI DASHBOARD

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW:
Superstore is a fictional retail company based in the United States. They specialize in selling furniture, office supplies, and technology products. This summer, they hired me as a Business Intelligence Analyst at their Seattle office. My role is to identify weaknesses and opportunities within their business, and my goal is to help them enhance their business growth and profitability.

DATASET:
The original dataset was obtained from the HiCounselor website. It contains 9993 sales transactions that occurred from 2019 to 2022. This dataset encompasses a wide range of information, including order specifics, geographical data, and product-related data. There are no missing values or any irrelevant data types and values. During the inspection process, a duplicate entry was identified and removed for accuracy. For those who are interested in viewing or downloading the refined dataset, it is available in my GitHub repository.
